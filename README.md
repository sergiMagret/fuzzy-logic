# Fuzzy logic examples with fuzzylite
Here are three examples of AI with fuzzy logic implemented with fuzzylite, all the programs at the end plot a graph
showing the different values the functions will take using matplotlib.
* **fuzzyoven.py**: This program tries to control an industrial oven to be around 180 ÂºC based on the temperature of the oven and the 
variation of temperature at a specific time.  

* **fuzzycopter.py**: This program tries to land a towercopter (a copter with only a degree of freedom - up/down) gently based on
the distance to the floor and the variation of distance at a specific time.  

* **fuzzytip.py**: This program decides what tip should give the waiter/restaurant based on the service and the quality of food,
logic of this program extracted from the examples of the library fuzzylite.  

To run the programs you will need fuzzylite, matplotlib and numpy.
